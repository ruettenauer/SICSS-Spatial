# Practical exercises

See below three practical exercises. Please choose the one you are most interested in. In case you are quick, try the remaining exercises. 

1. Add a control for the distance to Boris' home (10 Downing St, London SW1A 2AB, UK). 

    * You could either find the coordinates manually or you use `tmaptools` function `geocode_OSM()` using OpenStreetMaps. There are also Google Maps APIs like `ggmap` or `mapsapi` but they require registration.

2. Do results of our spatial models change if we use 10 nearest neighbours for the weights instead of Queens neighbours?

3. Can you think of a way of testing if higher order neighbours add additional information to the SLX regression model? 

    * The function `nblag()` is helpful.
    
# More exercises    

In case you are interested in geo-spatial data analysis, try the following. Note that this might be a bit more tricky and may require some time.

4. Add the amount of particulate matter (PM10, e.g. 2017) from [Defra](https://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/data/pcm-data) and check if pollution influences the housing prices. 

    * Note the following important sentence: "The coordinate system is OSGB and the coordinates represent the centre of each 1x1km cell".

    * `st_buffer`with the options `nQuadSegs  = 1, endCapStyle = 'SQUARE'` provides an easy way to get points into grids
    
5. Add some more demographic variables from the Census 2011.

    * The `nomisr` package provides an API to nomis. See the [Vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nomisr/vignettes/introduction.html). Make sure to restrict you request to London only (Guest users are limited to 25,000 rows per query).
    
    * You can browse the available data online, such as the Census 2011 [key statistics](https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/census/2011/key_statistics_uk).

<!-- * Add additional information to the MSOA from the 2011 census, for instance. -->

<!-- `nomisr`, see Vignette [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nomisr/vignettes/introduction.html). -->
