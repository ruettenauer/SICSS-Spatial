See below three practical exercises. Please choose the one you are most interested in. In case you are quick, try the remaining exercises. 

1. Add a control for the distance to Boris' home (10 Downing St, London SW1A 2AB, UK). 

    * You could either find the coordinates manually or you use `tmaptools` function `geocode_OSM()` using OpenStreetMaps. There are also Google Maps APIs like `ggmap` or `mapsapi` but they require registration.

2. Do results change if we use the 10 nearest neighbours for our weights instead of Queens neighbours?

3. Can you think of a way of testing if higher order neighbours add additional information to our regression model? 

    * The function `nblag()` is helpful.

In case you are interested in geo-spatial data analysis, try the following. Note that this might be a bit more tricky and may require some time.

4. Try adding the amount of particulate matter (PM10, e.g. 2017) from Defra: https://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/data/pcm-data. 

    * Note the following important sentence: "The coordinate system is OSGB and the coordinates represent the centre of each 1x1km cell".

    * `st_buffer`with the options `nQuadSegs  = 1, endCapStyle = 'SQUARE'` provides an easy way to get points into grids

<!-- * Add additional information to the MSOA from the 2011 census, for instance. -->
