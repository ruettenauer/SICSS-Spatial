@article{Candido.2020,
 abstract = {Brazil currently has one of the fastest-growing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemics in the world. Because of limited available data, assessments of the impact of nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on this virus spread remain challenging. Using a mobility-driven transmission model, we show that NPIs reduced the reproduction number from {\textgreater}3 to 1 to 1.6 in S{\~a}o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Sequencing of 427 new genomes and analysis of a geographically representative genomic dataset identified {\textgreater}100 international virus introductions in Brazil. We estimate that most (76{\%}) of the Brazilian strains fell in three clades that were introduced from Europe between 22 February and 11 March 2020. During the early epidemic phase, we found that SARS-CoV-2 spread mostly locally and within state borders. After this period, despite sharp decreases in air travel, we estimated multiple exportations from large urban centers that coincided with a 25{\%} increase in average traveled distances in national flights. This study sheds new light on the epidemic transmission and evolutionary trajectories of SARS-CoV-2 lineages in Brazil and provides evidence that current interventions remain insufficient to keep virus transmission under control in this country.},

@phdthesis{Junger.2019,
 abstract = {This book demonstrates the use of georeferenced data for social science survey research which builds upon survey data enriched with geo-coordinates. It reviews the prerequisites and challenges of applying these data to different social science research questions, highlighting the different branches of an interdisciplinary effort. At the center of this presentation is the method of spatial linking: the combination of georeferenced survey data with information from auxiliary geospatial data sources. A collection of spatial linking methods is applied in this book's empirical applications which underline these methods' flexibility in different social science sub-disciplines, such as health and family, political attitudes, and environmental inequalities. For this purpose, georeferenced survey data from the German General Social Survey (GGSS) 2014 and the GESIS Panel are used. These empirical applications are part of an emerging field of research for social scientists, requiring new analytic skills from diverse and foreign disciplines, like ecology and engineering. Navigating the organizational and technical requirements for the analysis of georeferenced survey data enables researchers to answer new and innovative research questions.

Dieses Buch besch{\"a}ftigt sich mit der Nutzung georeferenzierter Daten in der sozialwissenschaftlichen Umfrageforschung, deren Ausgangspunkt Umfragedaten sind, die mit Geokoordinaten angereichert wurden. Es widmet sich den Voraussetzungen und Herausforderungen, solche Daten f{\"u}r verschiedene sozialwissenschaftliche Fragestellungen nutzbar zu machen und betont dabei die verschiedenen interdisziplin{\"a}ren Verzweigungen dieses Unterfangens. Im Mittelpunkt der Pr{\"a}sentation steht die Methode der r{\"a}umlichen Verkn{\"u}pfung: die Kombination georeferenzierter Umfragedaten mit Informationen aus externen Geodatenquellen. Anhand mehrerer, aus unterschiedlichen Subdisziplinen der Sozialwissenschaften stammender empirischer Anwendungen im Bereich Familie und Gesundheit, politische Einstellungen sowie Umwelt und Ungleichheit wird die Flexibilit{\"a}t der Methode in Form verschiedener r{\"a}umlicher Verkn{\"u}pfungen betont. Dazu werden georeferenzierte Umfragedaten der Allgemeinen Bev{\"o}lkerungsumfrage Sozialwissenschaften (ALLBUS) 2014 und dem GESIS Panel 2014 verwendet. Diese empirischen Anwendungen sind Teil eines aufstrebenden Forschungsfelds f{\"u}r Sozialforschende, welches neue analytische Fertigkeiten aus verschiedenen anderen Fachbereichen wie der {\"O}kologie oder des Ingenieurswesen erfordert. Werden die organisatorischen und technischen Anforderungen zur Analyse georeferenzierter Umfragedaten gemeistert, er{\"o}ffnet sich Forschenden die M{\"o}glichkeit, neue und innovative Fragestellungen zu beantworten.

@article{Keuschnigg.2019,
 abstract = {Superlinear growth in cities has been explained as an emergent consequence of increased social interactions in dense urban environments. Using geocoded microdata from Swedish population registers, we remove population composition effects from the scaling relation of wage income to test how much of the previously reported superlinear scaling is truly attributable to increased social interconnectivity in cities. The Swedish data confirm the previously reported scaling relations on the aggregate level, but they provide better information on the micromechanisms responsible for them. We find that the standard interpretation of urban scaling is incomplete as social interactions only explain about half of the scaling parameter of wage income and that scaling relations substantively reflect differences in cities' sociodemographic composition. Those differences are generated by selective migration of highly productive individuals into larger cities. Big cities grow through their attraction of talent from their hinterlands and the already-privileged benefit disproportionally from urban agglomeration.},

@book{LeSage.2009.0,
 abstract = {Although interest in spatial regression models has surged in recent years, a comprehensive, up-to-date text on these approaches does not exist. Filling this void, Introduction to Spatial Econometrics presents a variety of regression methods used to analyze spatial data samples that violate the traditional assumption of independence between observations. It explores a wide range of alternative topics, including maximum likelihood and Bayesian estimation, various types of spatial regression specifications, and applied modeling situations involving different circumstances.


Leaders in this field, the authors clarify the often-mystifying phenomenon of simultaneous spatial dependence. By presenting new methods, they help with the interpretation of spatial regression models, especially ones that include spatial lags of the dependent variable. The authors also examine the relationship between spatiotemporal processes and long-run equilibrium states that are characterized by simultaneous spatial dependence. MATLAB{\circledR} toolboxes useful for spatial econometric estimation are available on the authors' websites.


This work covers spatial econometric modeling as well as numerous applied illustrations of the methods. It encompasses many recent advances in spatial econometric models-including some previously unpublished results.


Presents formal, systematic motivations for spatial econometric regression models.


Discusses simultaneous estimation of model parameters and model selection using MCMC model comparison methods and Bayesian model averaging.


Offers unique, computational insights on determinants, weight matrices, and approaches for handling large spatial data sets.


Addresses the economic implications of spatial models.


Extends techniques to other settings, such as those with discrete dependent variables, flow data, spatiotemporal data, and panel data.


Provides MATLAB code for implementing the methods presented on the authors' websites.},

@article{LeSage.2014.0,
 abstract = {Regional scientists frequently work with regression relationships involving sample data that is spatial in nature. For example, hedonic house-price regressions relate selling prices of houses located at points in space to characteristics of the homes as well as neighborhood characteristics. Migration, commodity, and transportation flow models relate the size of flows between origin and destination regions to the distance between origin and destination as well as characteristics of both origin and destination regions. Regional growth regressions relate growth rates of a region to past period own- and nearby-region resource inputs used in production. Spatial data typically violates the assumption that each observation is independent of other observations made by ordinary regression methods. This has econometric implications for the quality of estimates and inferences drawn from non-spatial regression models. Alternative methods for producing point estimates and drawing inferences for relationships involving spatial data samples is the broad topic covered by spatial econometrics. Like any sub-discipline, spatial econometrics has its quirks, many of which reflect influential past literature that has gained attention in both theoretical and applied work. This article asks the question: ``What should regional scientists who wish to use regression relationships involving spatial data in an effort to shed light on questions of interest in regional science know about spatial econometric methods?''},

@article{Toth.2021,
 abstract = {Social networks amplify inequalities by fundamental mechanisms of social tie formation such as homophily and triadic closure. These forces sharpen social segregation, which is reflected in fragmented social network structure. Geographical impediments such as distance and physical or administrative boundaries also reinforce social segregation. Yet, less is known about the joint relationships between social network structure, urban geography, and inequality. In this paper we analyze an online social network and find that the fragmentation of social networks is significantly higher in towns in which residential neighborhoods are divided by physical barriers such as rivers and railroads. Towns in which neighborhoods are relatively distant from the center of town and amenities are spatially concentrated are also more socially segregated. Using a two-stage model, we show that these urban geography features have significant relationships with income inequality via social network fragmentation. In other words, the geographic features of a place can compound economic inequalities via social networks.},
